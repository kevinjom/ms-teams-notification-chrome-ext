# MS Teams notification chrome extension

A really tricky and simple chrome extension to show a notification when you get a new MS Teams message.

It does **NOT** work correctly sometimes atm, but better than nothing.

## Usage

- open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
- enable devloper mode (on the top right)
- click load upacked, select this repo (clone it first)

## Contribution
 Please, we can't rely on [chrome tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs) API.
